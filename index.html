            <h2>STORIES, STYLE, AND SPORTING GOODS AT ADIDAS, SINCE 1949</h2>
            <p>
              Through sports, we have the power to change lives. Sports keep us
              fit. They keep us mindful. They bring us together. Athletes
              inspire us. They help us to get up and get moving. And sporting
              goods featuring the latest technologies help us beat our personal
              best. adidas is home to the runner, the basketball player, the
              soccer kid, the fitness enthusiast, the yogi. And even the weekend
              hiker looking to escape the city. The 3-Stripes are everywhere and
              anywhere. In sports. In music. On life's stages. Before the
              whistle blows, during the race, and at the finish line. We're here
              to support creators. To improve their game. To live their lives.
              And to change the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              adidas is about more than sportswear and workout clothes. We
              partner with the best in the industry to co-create. This way we
              offer our fans the sporting goods, style and clothing that match
              the athletic needs, while keeping sustainability in mind. We're
              here to support creators. Improve their game. Create change. And
              we think about the impact we have on our world.

            <h2>WORKOUT CLOTHES, FOR ANY SPORT</h2>
            <p>
              adidas designs for athletes of all kinds. Creators who love to
              change the game. People who challenge conventions, break the
              rules, and define new ones. Then break them all over again. We
              design sports apparel that gets you moving, winning, and living
              life to the fullest. We create bras and tights for female athletes
              who play just as hard as the men. From low to high support.
              Maximum comfort. We design, innovate and iterate. We test new
              technologies in action. On the field, the track, the court, and in
              the pool. We're inspired by retro workout clothes, creating new
              streetwear essentials. From NMD and Ozweego to our Firebird
              tracksuits. From Stan Smith to Superstar. Classic sports models
              are brought back to life on the streets and the stages around the
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through our collections we blur the borders between high fashion
              and high performance. Like our adidas by Stella McCartney athletic
              clothing collection - designed to look the part inside and outside
              of the gym. Or some of our adidas Originals lifestyle pieces, that
              can be worn as sports apparel too. Our lives are constantly
              changing. Becoming more and more versatile. And adidas designs
              with that in mind.
